# Code review testing

Things to test in this repo:
 - Check that commits get squashed properly before they're merged
 - Check how the UI looks when a PR is broken into lots of commits
 - Add a team as a reviewer and check that they get notified
 - Create a commit somewhere where an 'owner' should be added as a blocking reviewer. Check that they are added and it can't be merged without their approval.
 - Stack revisions and check it all makes sense, test merging them in different orders.
